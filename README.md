# Aliens Visiting Earth

In Aliens Visiting Earth, players embody the role of an alien who is thrilled at their discovery of our home planet. However, in a reversal of the traditional space-invaders theming, you must fight off hostile human weapons and retaliation.This side scrolling shoot-em-up involved the creation of original code architecture in C# to manage game states, bullets and enemies, and player objects. Traditional object collision is implemented, in addition to enemy wave spawning, highscore system management, and player input management.
