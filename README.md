## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: side view
-   Camera Movement: stationary camera with scrolling background
                    <br>-stationary ceiling and floor
-   Player Health: the player has 3 lives, each time they get hit they lose a life
-   End Condition: -level ends when the player has lost all 3 lives
                   <br>-no win condition, this is an arcade style game with a highschore system instead
-   Scoring: each time you kill an enemy, you get a certain number of points
            <br>-point amounts increment as time goes on
            <br>-secondary (harder) enemy time gives more points
